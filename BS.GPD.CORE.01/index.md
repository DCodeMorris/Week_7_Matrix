## **BS.GPD.CORE.02 Evidence**

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
	
I have acquired a large amount of knowledge since I started my journey in the Computer Science program in November of 2018. The additional confidence I gained allows me to continue excelling in the computer science field. This ePortfolio serves as an incentive to illustrate my competency and mastery of my professional goals to develop a successful career in computer science. In completing my journey, I will pursue a career in Cybersecurity, a field closely associated with computer science as a top option. While reviewing my skills and abilities throughout my provided technical artifacts, I show I have a strong foundation in computer science with heightened knowledge of importance for security that powers my drive for becoming a Cybersecurity professional.
