To enhance the visual fidelity of my game, I added a dynamic visual effect using Unreal Engine's Niagara system. The effect consists of a particle system that emits red glowing particles within specific areas of the game levels, creating an aesthetically pleasing and technically advanced element.  The Niagara system provided control over the movement, size range, speed, shape, and color of the particles. This level of control allowed me to create a visually striking effect that added depth and immersion to the game environment. By leveraging the capabilities of the Niagara system, I was able to design and develop a professional-quality visual effect that enhances the overall visual appeal and engagement of the game.  This explanation effectively highlights my use of technical and aesthetic design principles to create engaging and dynamic experiences.
