## **BS.GPD.CORE.02 Evidence**

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
	
I have acquired a large amount of knowledge since I started my journey in the Computer Science program in November of 2018. The additional confidence I gained allows me to continue excelling in the computer science field. This ePortfolio serves as an incentive to illustrate my competency and mastery of my professional goals to develop a successful career in computer science. In completing my journey, I will pursue a career in Cybersecurity, a field closely associated with computer science as a top option. While reviewing my skills and abilities throughout my provided technical artifacts, I show I have a strong foundation in computer science with heightened knowledge of importance for security that powers my drive for becoming a Cybersecurity professional.

### Conclusion:

<p style="text-indent: 55px;">
I have showcased my knowledge and skills where I design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices (data structures and algorithms). This outcome is met by my use of regex patterns in <strong><code>`create_regex_pattern`</code></strong>. It showcases my understanding of algorithmic principles to create efficient and flexible search algorithms. The use of the dictionary I used <strong><code>`filter_criteria`</code></strong> that manages filter criteria demonstrates my understanding of computer science practices, which aligns with the concept of using data structures to manage and organize data systematically. I centralized filter criteria in a dictionary that reduces redundancy, making the core more maintainable, which involves a trade-off between upfront organization and long-term maintainability. I manage the design trade-offs by consolidating logic, implementing regex patterns, and organizing filter criteria centrally. This provides a more readable, efficient, and modular solution while addressing the challenges present in my original code.
